    <h1>Lord Ganesha: The Remover of Obstacles</h1>
    <p>Ganesha is a god who often asked for help with various endeavours, especially business deals.</p>
    <p>He has multiple birth stories, but one popular one says he was created by parvati from dirt while Shiva was away. When shiva returned, he cut off Ganesha's head, but later replaced it with an elephant's head, bringing him back to life.</p>
    <p>Lord Ganesha, with his elephant head, is revered as the god of wisdom, intellect, and new beginnings. He is invoked before any auspicious event to remove obstacles and grant success.</p>
    <p>His broken tusk symbolizes sacrifice and the importance of overcoming ego. Ganesha's vehicle, the mouse (or rat), represents humility and adaptability.</p>
